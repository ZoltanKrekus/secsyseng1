According to unconfirmed rumors, there are several vulnerabilities in the services that are already being actively exploited by hackers to get the source code of unreleased closed source software as well as to so-called "flags". Of course, all your data is still secure! We're working on getting those bastards telling junk about our beautiful services! Spread the news in the dark scene, if you happen to have connections there! We <em>are</em> getting them!
