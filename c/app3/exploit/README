##############################################

1. INTRODUCTION

This application is a small example of a shell injection vulnerability. 
The program takes a string as argument and returns it in 1337 speak. It uses the c function
system(char *string), which makes it vulnerable to shell injection. The fixed program filters
every special character, that could used in a shell injection and replaces it with an
underscore.

|-src-vuln
|---1337echo.c: The program vulnerable to shell injection
|
|-src-fixed
|---1337echo.c: The program no longer vulnerable to shell injection

3. INSTALL

Just run

make

in this directory (exploit) to compile both the vulnerable and the not vulnerable program.

4. USAGE

Run 1337echo in the folder src-vuln or src-fixed (depending on which you want to try):

./1337echo "This is a test!" # don't forget the double quotes!

An example exploiting the vulnerability would be (please use with care!):

./1337echo "I will exploit! && rm *"

Have fun!
