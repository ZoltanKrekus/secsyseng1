A2-Broken Authentication and Session Management
##############################################


1. INTRODUCTION

This is a small web application where a user can login via username/password combination or session id.
The session id is very weak and can be easily broken.

3. INSTALL
Tomcat with JSF 2.2 needed. WebApp has to be deployed in Tomcat

4. USAGE

Running the application
To run the application, you need a webserver with Tomcat running and JSF installed.

Starting the application
If the webserver is running, open the web application in your browser of choice: http://localhost:8080/SecSysEngLab1cApp1/

Logging in
You can login with a predefined set of users. Below is the list of users with username:password
admin:admin
root:foo
max:mustermann
After a successful login the user is assigned a session id. If the user was already logged in he can also use this session id to login in a faster way.

Vulnerability
The sessionId assigned to each user is weak. Basically it's simply incremented each time a user logs in, therefor one could write a script which tries calculated sessionIds in a range from 1 to Long.MaxValue
