Running the application
To run the application, you need a webserver with PHP5 installed. The webserver needs to have read and write access to the /images directory.

Starting the application
If the webserver is running, call the src-*/index.html to get to the entry point of the application. On the left you can navigate to a gallery with images and to the login page.

Logging in
You can log in by going to the 'Login' section and typing in 'password'. Now you are able to modify the description of the images (this is the way the application was designed for).

Vulnerability
Through accessing the file src-vuln/modify.php?id=[image-id]&text=[descr], you are able to set the description of an arbitrary image, even when not logged in. The vulnerability happens because the modify.php file misses a proper session and authorization handling.
